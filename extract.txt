Bioaccumulation is not to be expected (log P(o/w) < 1)
Waste Disposal Method: Dispose of in accordance with local, state and federal regulations regulations.
This material should be fully characterized for toxicity and possible reactivity prior to
disposal (40 CFR 261). Use which results in chemical or physical change or
contamination may subject it to regulation as a hazardous waste. Along with properly
characterizing all waste materials, consult  all applicable regulations regarding the proper
disposal of this material.
Container contents should be completely used and containers should be emptied prior to
discard. Container rinsate could be considered a RCRA hazardous waste and must be
disposed of with care and in full compliance with federal, state and local regulations.
Larger empty containers, such as drums, should be returned to the distributor or to a
drum reconditioner. To assure proper disposal of smaller empty 14. Transport Information containers, consult with
state and local regulations and disposal authorities.
